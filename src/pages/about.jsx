          The Spectral Methodology
        </h1>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-16">Our Approach</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          We create fast and effective web products. Helping small businesses,
          entrepreneurs, and professionals enhance their endeavors is truly our
          passion, and we're grateful to be able to provide it for those who are
          looking to grow their digital footprint.

          It's unfair to have to spend thousands of dollars upfront, and even
          more every month thereafter for static websites. It favors most to
          have the type of service that allows them to invest more into creating
          better products and services for their clientele. Spectral
          demonstrates a business model that lets you participate on the web at
          a reasonable rate and still provide a custom web presence.

          Using website builders can negatively affect website performance,
          which search engines, like Google, use to rank you amongst similar
          entities. They often lack the ability to provide optimization tools,
          easy management for the ever-growing number of plugins added as your
          site matures, and offer scarce support without having to spend a
          fortune. Spectral Web Designs builds websites from scratch without
          these bulky 3rd-party ecosystems in order to combat these concerns. We
          additionally include unlimited content and media updates, on-site SEO
          management, and user support as needed to our standard and premium
          partners.
